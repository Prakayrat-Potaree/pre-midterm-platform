## Reflection on Copilot Usage

I used GitHub Copilot when implementing the task management functions.  
Copilot suggested a function that stored tasks in localStorage.  
While the logic was correct, it did not meet the requirement since we needed Firebase as the database.  

I modified the code to use Firebase Firestore instead.  
This saved me time on function structure but I still needed to adjust details to match the project requirements.  

In conclusion, Copilot was helpful for generating initial code, but I had to review and refine it.
